"""
matcher.py — Core subset-sum matching algorithm.

The central problem in bank reconciliation is: given a deposit of amount D,
find the subset of outstanding invoices whose amounts sum to D (within a
small tolerance for rounding differences and wire fees).

This is a variant of the subset-sum problem. We use two strategies:
- Brute-force combinations for small invoice sets (n <= 20)
- Dynamic programming for larger sets

See docs/ALGORITHM.md for a detailed explanation.

Typical usage
-------------
>>> from src.matcher import match_payments
>>> results = match_payments(deposits, invoices, tolerance=0.01)
>>> for r in results:
...     print(r["status"], r["deposit_amount"])
